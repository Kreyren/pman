in quiet mode it is just
‚òê target -> parent (when building)
‚òí target -> parent   (on pass)
‚ö† target -> parent   (on fail but continue)
üõë target -> parent  (on stop)
‚àé                    (on successful completion)

in normal mode it is
?  target -> parent
‚òê recipe truncated to 70 cols, using C0 control pics
  etc
then
‚òí target -> parent   (on pass)
